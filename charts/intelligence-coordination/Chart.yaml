# ICOS Intelligence Coordination
# ----------------------------------------
# The ICOS Coordination API has two goals:
# a) First, models can be pre-built and added to the API as specified in a Developer guide. The API outputs model predictions or information about a new model trained in this scenario. This is performed for easy integration of ML models with automated functions of the OS developed in ICOS.
# b) Second, part of this API is targeted to extend ML libraries to make them available to a technical user to save storage resources in devices with access to the API. In this context, the API returns a framework environment to allow users easy plug-and-play with the environment already available in the API.

description: A Helm chart for the ICOS Intelligence Coordination API. The AI coordination module facilitates optimisation, predictive analytics, and applying machine learning models across the edge-cloud continuum. This API is callable from the Shell, but not integrated with other ICOS components. Version 1.3 also adds MLFlow and Jupyter notebooks with examples on how to use the API.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "0.2.0"
