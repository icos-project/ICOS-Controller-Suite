  *  ICOS Intelligence Coordination
  *  ----------------------------------------
  *  The ICOS Coordination API has two goals:
  *  a) First, models can be pre-built and added to the API as specified in a Developer guide. The API outputs model predictions or information about a new model trained in this scenario. This is performed for easy integration of ML models with automated functions of the OS developed in ICOS.
  *  b) Second, part of this API is targeted to extend ML libraries to make them available to a technical user to save storage resources in devices with access to the API. In this context, the API returns a framework environment to allow users easy plug-and-play with the environment already available in the API.
